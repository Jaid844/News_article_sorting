# News Article Sorting
 News article sorting is a vital process that categorizes articles into specific topics or categories such as Politics, Business, Sports, Technology, and Entertainment.
 Utilizing advanced techniques like embeddings and machine learning, news article sorting algorithms can accurately analyze and classify articles based on their content and semantic meaning.
 Efficient news article sorting enables users to access relevant information quickly, saving time and providing a personalized news consumption experience.
 By automating the sorting process, news platforms can enhance user engagement, improve content recommendation systems, and deliver targeted news content to their audience.
The development of robust news article sorting algorithms contributes to a safer consumption experience by ensuring reliable information access and minimizing the risk of misinformation.

(The link may take some time as it is a free instance and huge model a sentence trasnformer is in render or may fail :) which I suggest Use a POSTMAN API for the calls)

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the Kaggle website 
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learn-ai-bbc/data
## Features
The features or attributes considered for News Article 
Bussiness,Tech,Sports,Entertainment,Politics.
## Model Training
The approach of embedding and training involves leveraging advanced embedding techniques such as Sentence Transformers and SpaCy to capture the semantic meaning of news articles.
These embeddings serve as powerful representations of the article's content, enabling a deeper understanding and analysis of its textual information.
By training machine learning models on labeled datasets, we can effectively classify news articles into categories based on their embedded representations.
This approach enhances the accuracy of the classification process, allowing for more precise categorization and personalized news recommendations.
The combination of embeddings and training enables a robust and efficient system for sorting news articles, empowering users to access relevant content that aligns with their interests.

The training process involves:

Data preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and performing feature encoding or scaling if required.
Splitting the dataset: Dividing the dataset into training and test sets for model evaluation.

Model training: Training the chosen model using the training dataset.
Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.
